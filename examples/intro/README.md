![A screenshot of the homepage](./public/screenshot.png)

an example of using the `ryannhg/elm-spa` package __without the CLI tool__.
This is just using [the Elm package](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/ryannhg/elm-spa/latest).

This example uses [elm-live](elm-live.com), so that single page routing works as intended.

### try it out!

```bash
npm start
```
