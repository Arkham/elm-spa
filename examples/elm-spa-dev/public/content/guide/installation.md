# Installation

Getting started with elm-spa is easy! Make sure you have the latest stable version of [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your system. At the time of writing, I'm using node version `12.18.1`.

```terminal
npx elm-spa init our-elm-spa
```

This one-time command will create a new project in a folder called `our-elm-spa`. The contents of that folder are explained in the next section: [Project Structure](/guide/project-structure)
