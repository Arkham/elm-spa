# Guide

Welcome to the __elm-spa__ guide! This guide assumes you are somewhat familiar with Elm and have checked out [the official guide](https://guide.elm-lang.org).

If you have any questions after reading through this, please check out the `#elm-spa-users` channel in the [official Elm Slack](https://elmlang.herokuapp.com/). There are also wonderful folks in the `#beginners` channel that are happy to help with any other Elm questions you have.

## what is elm-spa?

__elm-spa__ is a companion CLI tool that:

1. Automatically generates URL routes
1. Provides a common project structure

It was inspired by a project in the Vue.js community, called NuxtJS- to make building real world applications easier in Elm!

If you have ever wondered how to call a REST API, handle user authentication, create components, or organize your application- __elm-spa__ is here to help.
